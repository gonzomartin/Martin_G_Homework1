        <p>I decided to talk a little bit of my self here, i guess is always a good option to be open to talk about different thing, or hobbies. As everything in this life, we have to start for the begining, so nice to meet you, my name is Gonzalo Martin A., im from Cali, Colombia, im 25 years old, i studied Visual Comunication desing here in Cali too, and got my degree 2 years ago. Since i was a kid i have always loved to collect things, i started collecting pokemon cards, then YuGiOh, then i had an obsession with Lego and i started collecting Lego too. By today, after i left my moms house 3 years ago, i have learn a little bit more to let thing go, you know, every time that i move my self i had to throw things away. And doing that i understand that it is not a matter of how many collections you have, its a matter of what really matters to collect, and now that im leaving the country, i want to list you the collections taht i know are going to follow me all my life.</p>
